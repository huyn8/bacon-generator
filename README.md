#### The objective of the Kevin Bacon Game is to link a movie actor to Kevin Bacon via shared movie roles. The minimum number of links is an actor’s Bacon number. For instance, Tom Hanks has a Bacon number of 1; he was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon. Sally Field has a Bacon number of 2, because she was in Forrest Gump with Tom Hanks, who was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon. Almost all well-known actors have a Bacon number of 1 or 2.


#### The program computes Bacon numbers for entries in a movie database such as this [one](https://github.com/huyn8/bacon-generator/blob/0e4bea7cc3c2ac03be298c3865f6212b7e845337/bacon-source-code/bacon.txt). The program will take a single command line argument: the name of the database file. The program will then, for each actor in the database, output (on one line) the actor’s name, a tab character (’\t’) and the actor’s Bacon number.

#### The program works similarly like this https://oracleofbacon.org/

#### The program was compiled and run via Linux (g++)
